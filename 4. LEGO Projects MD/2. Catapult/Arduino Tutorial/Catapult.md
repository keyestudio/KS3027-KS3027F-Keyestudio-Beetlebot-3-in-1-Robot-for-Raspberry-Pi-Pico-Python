**Catapult**

1.  **Description：**

    A catapult is a ballistic device used to launch a projectile a great
    distance without the aid of gunpowder or other propellants –
    particularly various types of ancient and medieval siege engines.
    ... We will make a catapult with LEGO building blocks. Equipped with
    servos and gears, the car has LEGO tower used to carry projectiles.

    As the servo rotates to a proper angle then push the long arm
    backward a projectile will be launched.

    Build up a few target objects with building blocks(object A, B, C,
    D, E) and keep them in a certain distance away the catapult and
    connect Wifi.

    drive the catapult to launch a building block.

    Then release the button

    make the long arm return to the original state. Next, let’s check if
    the object A is hit by the launched block

    You can repeat above steps to hit the object B, C and D
